Hello! This is Jin. 

I am a first-year PhD student working with [Marvin Chun](https://www.marvinchun.com/) at Yale University. I obtained a M.A. in Psychology from the University of Chicago working with [Yuan Chang (YC) Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/) and then worked as a research specialist with [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/). I received undergraduate training from Peking University, where I double-majored in Psychology and Environmental Sciences and was mentored by [Xin Zhang](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/szdw/qzjy/fjs/zx/index.htm). At SANS2025 in Chicago, I owed Hayoung Song and JeongJun Park a drink which I will pay them back at SANS2026 (or SFN2025) in San Diego.

<h2>Research Program</h2>

I am a computational cognitive neuroscientist studying the neurocomputational mechanisms of everyday human cognition using fMRI, machine learning, deep learning, large language models and naturalistic paradigms. Below I feature some main research threads:

**I. Decoding human cognition from neural dynamics in naturalistic contexts**

The human mind wanders frequently. How does the wandering mind reflect functional brain organization and everyday behavior? We developed predictive models of spontaneous thoughts from resting-state neural dynamics, which generalized to reveal robust associations with (1) neural synchrony during movie-watching and (2) cognitive abilities, psychiatric symptoms, and personality traits along a holistic, positive-negative axis of covariation. This suggests spontaneous thoughts may offer a unique window into the inner mental world, capturing individual idiosyncrasies and shaping daily subjective experience <u>(Ke et al., _in prep_)</u>. 

In a seperate line of work, we demonstrated that predictive models trained on whole-brain functional connectivity patterns reliably predicted moment-to-moment fluctuations in emotional arousal during movie-watching and generalized across diverse datasets and individuals, suggesting dynamic functional connectivity may encode a generalizable neural representation of emotional arousal during narrative perception [(Ke et al., _PLoS Comp Bio_, 2025)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012994). Our ongoing work further shows that varieties of arousal - wakefulness arousal (EEG spectral slope at rest), autonomic arousal (pupil during rest and podcast), and emotional arousal (ratings during movies) - are cross-predictable, suggesting a universal, overlapping neural representation across different varieties of arousal <u>(Bhattacharyya et al., _in prep_)</u>.

To further unpack the arousal representation and its consequences on real-world memory, we combined fMRI, graph theory, text analyses, and pupillometry and revealed that emotional arousal enhances memory encoding by strengthening functional integration across brain networks [(Park et al., _bioRxiv_, 2025)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.13.643125v1). Together, these work advance a cross-level understanding of emotional memories that bridges large-scale brain network dynamics, affective states and ongoing cognition.


**II. Narrative comprehension and its consequences on social cognition**

Edits in progress


**III. Cognitive and neural basis of attention**

Edits in progress


**IV. Brain-computer interface**

Much of my ongoing & future graduate research will focus on building non-invasive brain-computer interfaces to restore or enhance human cognitive abilities. Please stay tuned for this section.
